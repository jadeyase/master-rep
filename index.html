                        <h2>EXCERPTS</h2>
                        <p>Genelle, showing no emotion on her face, watched her sister leave. She leaned back in the chair and stared at the envelope. She had no idea what was inside and debated whether to open it or not. Finally, the suspense became too much so she leaned over and snatched it off the desk. She ripped it open so fast that she almost gave herself a paper cut. Inside was a white, flowered invitation with gold and teal lettering. As she turned the invitation over, a photograph fluttered to the floor. Genelle reached down and picked it up, almost afraid to look at it. Her jaw dropped and her breathe caught as she stared at the smiling couple. Reeling from shock, she felt like her stomach was about to drop into her feet. Something was very wrong with this picture. Very wrong!</p>
                        <hr/>
                        <p>At the sight of her standing there slack-jawed, he stuck out his hand to greet her and smiled as he introduced himself, “Hello! You must be Genelle. My name is Jayden Harper. Your aunt invited me to dinner.”</p>
                        <p>Genelle could feel the wheels turning in her head as she reflected on Aunt Bab’s comments on her attire earlier. So this is why she wanted me to look my best for dinner. Trying to process what was happening, she slammed the door in his face and rushed towards the kitchen. “Aunt Babs!” she yelled. “What did you do?”</p>
                        <hr/>
                        <p>She was on the popcorn aisle, trying to decide whether to remain loyal to Orville Redenbacher or try some other brand, when she heard a male voice call softly, “Genelle?” The voice sounded so familiar. When she whirled around, she saw Miles standing on the same aisle. He was wearing jogging shorts and a fitted T-shirt that showed off his muscular build. He walked towards her. “Hey there, I didn’t expect to run into you here.” Genelle, almost dropping the popcorn on the floor, willed herself to remain cool, calm, collected and distant. “Hey, Miles, yeah I’m just getting a few items.” Those familiar dimples appeared as he smiled, “How have you been?”</p>
